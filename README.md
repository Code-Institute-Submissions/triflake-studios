# TriFlake Studio

TriFlake Studio is an MVP website for a creative design agency. The aim is to create a minimum viable product to showcase the work of the agency, while creating a unique user experience for a graphic design company, a user sign up section.
This website also deploys all my course learning to date with the Code Institute. The elements I used in creating this website are all practical techniques I have been learning, working through the modules of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

You can view the deployed website here: <a href="https://triflake-studios.herokuapp.com/home" target="_blank">triflakestudio.herokuapp.com</a>

## Project Outline
The website has a dual purpose. It was created for a new local community group to use, but it also deploys all my course learning to date with the Code Institute. 
The elements I used in creating this website are all practical techniques I have been learning, working through the User Centric Front End Development modules of 
the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.
