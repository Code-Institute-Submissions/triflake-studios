# TriFlake Studio

TriFlake Studio is an MVP website for a creative design agency. The aim is to create a minimum viable product to showcase the work of the agency, while creating a unique user experience for a graphic design company, a user sign up section.
This website also deploys all my course learning to date with the Code Institute. The elements I used in creating this website are all practical techniques I have been learning, working through the modules of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

## Project Outline
The website has a dual purpose. It was created for a new local community group to use, but it also deploys all my course learning to date with the Code Institute. 
The elements I used in creating this website are all practical techniques I have been learning, working through the User Centric Front End Development modules of 
the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

## UX

The main function of the website is to create a visible presence for TriFlake Studio, a creative design studio.
To create the MVP I used the principles of Lean UX:

<img src="/media/leanux2.jpg" title="Cycle of Lean UX" height="300">

 - Outcomes, assumptions, hypotheses
 - Design
 - Create MVP
 - Research and Learning

The outcome was to create an MVP website for a creative design company,  with the expected elements e.g. portfolio, contact, about pages, but with some new features. 
With two types of users in mind, the graphic design company themselves, and their clients, I made assumptions and hypotheses about the elements that would be needed, 
common features, and new features that might appeal to both their existing clients but also to a new customer base. 

- *Strategy Plane* : Create a clean bright feel-good visually appealing website, with calls to action to engage new and existing customers.
    - User 1: TriFlake Studio - to showcase the work of the studio and create call to actions to easily contact the studio through the website.
    - User 2 : Clients - to view previous work of the studio and be able to contact them easily.
    - Research: creative design websites vary greatly, from extremely minimalist, to overly flashy. Surprisingly the majority of sites I looked at during the research phase were not great. They were either too brash and garish, or actually neglected looking, not a good look for a design studio! Some were so minimalist, to the point of being rude (as if to say “If you haven’t heard of us, then you are a nobody”).
    - The best design option was to reflect the mood of the studio, which is bright, bubbly, modern, yet fun. Minimalist fun, with a love of triangles. So focus was on bold bubbly headings, minimal content, with triangles reflecting the logo.
    - This website would have 2 features that did not exist on most creative design websites. The first is a shop page, where you can directly book consultations. The second is a user section with exclusive access for signed up members.

- *Scope Plane* : Creation of a MVW, minimum viable website with mixed content that has the potential to grow.
    - Needs: reflect the mood and work of the studio, with positive, enticing call to actions
    - Important features:
        - Impactful landing page that immediately reflects the modern playfulness of the studio.
        - Contact form - easy to fill in form
        - Portfolio and clients - visible work and client list to prove experience and competence
        - Shop - directly bookable consultancy sessions. Unusual for a design studio, but can help them grow as a forward thinking and approachable company. This could be a potential area of growth for the studio, in proposing different types of consultancy sessions, at different prices. It may appeal to SMEs with tight budgets and limited timelines, knowing upfront and directly how much sessions will cost. This could also help with cash flow, with prepaid work sessions providing instant payment, as opposed to the normal approach of chasing cheques. 
        - Client sign in area - again unusual for a design studio, but providing existing and potential customers with the feeling that they are getting more value for their money than just the consultancy or design work. This is another huge area of growth, not just for building potential customer base, but developing the studios reputation as resourceful, approachable, and as leaders in design innovation and trends.
---
- *Structure Plane*: A minimal website, with simple content yet visually stunning. The website needed to reflect the mood and work of the studio. 
With prominent calls to action, portfolio and shop features and sign in area. 

---
 - *Skeleton Plane* : Top priority is awareness about the studio and its services. Simple shapes and colours, give a sense of unity with playfulness. Minimalist but with bright colours and large triangles feature throughout the website, to play on the name and the logo. 
    - Support and connect with the project, through call to actions and links
    - Very structured navbar, with footer just on certain pages.
    - Deliberate color scheme, using the yellow, purple and blue that is in the logo.


Using UX strategies to develop the features and schema of the website , I first used post-its to build the initial wireframe, and develop the necessary features. I focused on the most prominent and important features I had listed in the strategy and scope research. I then developed the website layout, reframing the posits until I had a clearer idea of the website page layouts with links and buttons.

The next step was to develop the post-its groundwork into a paper wireframe of the website in both mobile and desktop view. Working on each page and section, developing the different placement and features, call to actions, and more.

- *Colour and Style* :

Using the visual identity of TriFlake Studio to develop a colour theme. I originally had a variety of colours to choose from, but narrowed down the selection to this:
You can see the full colour scheme I had to work with here: [colour-scheme](https://github.com/OrlaBr/triflake-studios/blob/master/ux/colour-scheme.jpg), but in the end I chose these colours:

I used Google Fonts 'Noto Sans', for the main body of the text, and 'Titan One' for the h1 and h2, for impact. It mirrored the visual identity of TriFlake Studio to have large bold colourful headings.
I then created more visual mockups using the online graphics platform 'Canva'. I developed the mobile view first, and when I was happy with that, I created the desktop version.
